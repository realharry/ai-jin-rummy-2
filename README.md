Play Jin Rummy with AI



Create a two-player Jin Rummy game, where an AI bot plays against a human player. The human player is positioned at the bottom of the screen. Use Pixi.js for rendering the game, and it should be mobile screen friendly. The AI bot should have a simple strategy for playing the game, such as always drawing from the deck and discarding the highest card. The game should display the player's hand, the AI bot's hand (face down), the discard pile, and the deck. The player should be able to select cards to discard and draw new cards from either the deck or the discard pile. Use React/TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS for app UI. Use Vite as the build tool.
